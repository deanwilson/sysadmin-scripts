Very quick demo that puts Ubuntu package events (install, remove, update)
on an MIT simile timeline

Run the script:
cat /var/log/dpkg.log | perl generate-package-events > $weblocation/packages.xml
Visit http://$web/packages.html

Notes
 * only works on Ubuntu
 * You'll need to change the release codename to get working links
 * it does print based xml generation. Which is Bad.
 * It's fugly
